\title{Compute Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimates and Merge With Data}
\usage{
computeKM(NN.df)
}
\arguments{
\item{NN.df}{A dataframe containing at least two columns: `time` and `outcome`,
where `time` is the time to event or censoring and `outcome` is a binary
indicator of the event occurrence (1 if the event occurred, 0 if censored).}
}
\value{
A dataframe similar to `NN.df` but with an additional column `surv_prob`
indicating the survival probability at each time point.
}
\description{
This function computes Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for a given dataset
and adds a column to the dataset with these survival probabilities.
}
\examples{
# Assuming NN.df has columns `time` and `outcome`
# new_df <- computeKM(NN.df)
}
