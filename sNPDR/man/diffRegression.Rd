\arguments{
\item{design.matrix.df}{Desgin matrix with variables: pheno.diff.vec (outcome variable as vector of diffs), attr.diff.vec (one predictor varialbe as vector of diffs) and optional covariates (regressors of non-interest) vector diffs.}

\item{regression.type}{(\code{"lm"}, \code{"binomial"})}

\item{fast.reg}{logical, whether regression is run with speedlm or speedglm, default as F}

\item{dof}{manual input for degrees of freedom, dof=0 lets R stats determine}
}
\value{
vector of regression stats to put into list for npdr and combine into matrix

\description{
Wrapper for lm and glm-binomial to run regression for a phenotype diff vector, one attribute diff vector with optional covariate adjustment. Organizes regression statistics into a vector and then all attribute statistics combined in npdr.
